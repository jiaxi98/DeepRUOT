## Introduction
Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learnt directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr√∂dinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```vim
git clone https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT
```

2. You can create a new conda environment (DeepRUOT) using

```vim
conda create -n DeepRUOT python=3.10 ipykernel -y
conda activate DeepRUOT
```

3. Install requirements and DeepRUOT
```vim
cd path_to_DeepRUOT
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## How to use

Please check the [Tutorials](https://deepruot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), where we provide four examples:
- Gene Regulatory Network Simulation
- Mouse Hematopoiesis scRNA Data
- Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) Data
- Gaussian Mixture Data (20D)

The examples can be found in the ```notebook``` directory. Additionally, the model weights required to reproduce the results in the paper can be found in the ```reproduce_model_weights``` directory. Both CUDA-enabled GPU and Mac MPS are supported for computation.

## Updated
We plan to release an updated version of DeepRUOT, along with our latest work, in which we computed some more challenging and complex datasets (https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11197).
